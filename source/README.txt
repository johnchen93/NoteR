About NoteR
-----------

NoteR is a light, academic paper tracking program written by a graduate student
in biochemistry. Meant to be the post-it notes of paper tracking programs, it
is fairly minimalistic and tries to cover all the basic note taking needs to
make your life a little easier.

The main features can be summarized in a few points:

* NoteR allows you to keep the title, author info and your own notes together
  in organized entries.
* Papers can be grouped by your own personal tags.
* A search function allows you to easily sort through entries.
* NoteR allows paper information to be fetched using pubmed IDs, which also
  provides a link to the paper's website.
* Pdf files can be automatically named and stored according to author
  information, simply by drag and drop.
